I've lost around 24 KG weight this year, going from 104 -> 80 KG, all while maintaining an occasional saatvik diet. Having said that, the title does sound clickbait-y but I have definitely not had onion, garlic etc for many, many days. 

So, most of these tips can be used by vegetarians too! Most of what I am going to point out in this article has been written a 100 times by others, but my experience is around an urban setting, Bengaluru specifically. Anyway, without going on and on about the justification, here's what worked for me, which may or may not work for you. :)

## Where you stay matters the most

Urban india is in shambles. Roads are non-existent and broken, and going out will literally kill you. Infrastructure is a real problem, and cribbing about it will not help. What helps is, you have to stay in your bubble. Gated societies are your friend here. When you filter out where you live, have these as non-negotiables:
1. A gym which is decently equipped and has hygienic toilets
   
   You dont need a fancy gym or expensive equipment, but look for basic set of weights, machines, and make sure the toilet is clean! At most good societies this will not be a problem but make it a point to check.
2. A walking path
   
   While there might not be a dedicated walking path in most older societies, private walkways across blocks are regularly used by residents for their morning and evening walk. This should be present in most societies with more than 3 blocks. Filter for those. 
3. A swimming pool
   
   This is very contrarian but IF YOU CAN SWIM, then having a good pool is a big big help in getting a good workout in, especially in summer time when the heat is a problem. I personally prefer evening swims, around 6-8 PM, but you can filter out times based on what works for you. So if you can't swim - my suggestion is, whenever it is summer time, sign up to learn. Apart from learning a new skill, you gain a cardio workout that you can do anytime you prefer.
## Food 

Weight loss is done on a two prong scale, most people will try to do 50% of their effort in exercise and the rest on food. However, 80% of the battle is in maintaining your diet in the correct way and not deviating from it. I have had my challenges, but here's what has worked and what hasn't

1. Whey is your friend: Make a note of this, and regardless of your exercise levels, start having whey + water. It is 100% saatvik and you can definitely have it. However, which brand is a big question that comes up here. My favourite clean ones are maxn, muscle nectar and the whole truth(Look online for coupon codes, for all three). Now there are variations after variations, and there are non-flavoured ones as well. I am a chocolate person, so whatever chocolate flavoured whey I like, I consume.
2. Have curd or chaash and have it everyday. Curd is an excellent probiotic and gut friendly too. Has decent amount of protein.
3. Paneer/Tofu/Soya: These three foods are also a must to include. Do not give me shit about soya and the other controversies, stfu and eat it. Thanks. 
4. Water, 3-4L of it a day. Do not buy those big ass 2L bottles. Those are plastic and not good anyway. You dont need anything fancy. get a good 1L copper bottle, make sure you do the mental math to finish it thrice or four times. Just carry it around. 
5. If you have cravings for fried food, make them in an air frier. 
6. A fruit a day is compulsory, try apples or pomegranates, but any fiber rich fruit is great.
7. Get used to eating 1 roti instead of two or three. Eat lots of veggies and dal, but not too much. Add a protein source in your lunch and dinner. Once, it could be curd, another time, it could be paneer. 
8. Get your macros right. Get your BMR, and plan meals to keep it just below that rate.
9. Lots of cucumbers in salads are excellent choices
## Walk, a lot!

I feel like among all the discourse around food and activity levels, people forget that we can walk too. Try to do 10-11K steps a day. The more the better! I do 15K a day on average. Yes, it is quite a lot initially, so ramp it up slowly. Once you start doing it you will enjoy it a lot, and since you are in a society, stick to a regular time. You'll even make friends if you are not too scared to talk to actual real humans.

I personally prefer to walk at nights, since it is much more quieter. But you can do whatever works for you.

## Exercise!

A bit of strength training goes a long way, regardless of your gender.

Now, I am not an expert and will not go into depths on push/pull etc. [fmhy.net](fmhy.net) has an entire section dedicated to fitness, go check it out and create a plan for yourself. Or you could be like me and hire someone to help with that.
